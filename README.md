#heres an emergency task guys please help

#on the pi at the moment customer fills in  FN SN mobile yeah and then submit and then goes into dialler 8808

#but we do have all the customer infor like address  etc..     is there a way the system can match the mobile in the excel  and then injuct the rest of the info into dialler

- where is it pulling those data m8? like addres etc
#we have the excel file

-i think the best way to automate it is to make a db for this excel file content , and then we can automate the rest when injecting

#what would be the best way ?
#also this all has to be stealth put on cut8 server please
# we'll mobile  match better right?

- but much better to match using mobile number
#yes and then inject it into 8808  but we have to be carefull

# we dont want that excel file getting out there at all or even the mobiles or else it will be the end of this company
